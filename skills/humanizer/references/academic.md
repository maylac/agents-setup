# Academic / medical manuscript humanizing

**Do NOT apply the PERSONALITY AND SOUL section from SKILL.md to academic text.** Academic manuscripts require precise, objective language, not injected voice. The goal is to strip AI-isms while maintaining data integrity (numbers, statistics, findings must stay exact) and the formal register of medical/scientific journals.

Medical before/after examples below are adapted for clinical literature.

## CONTENT PATTERNS

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> Heart failure represents a pivotal challenge in the evolving landscape of type 2 diabetes care, affecting more than one in five adults aged over 65 years with diabetes. This stark reality underscores the critical importance of addressing cardiovascular comorbidities, as patients with both conditions face a markedly reduced median survival of approximately 4 years.

**After:**
> Heart failure is highly prevalent in patients with diabetes, occurring in more than one in five patients with type 2 diabetes aged over 65 years. Patients with both diabetes and heart failure have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of approximately 4 years.

---

### 2. Undue Emphasis on Notability and Media Coverage

**Words to watch:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence

**Problem:** LLMs hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often listing sources without context.

**Before:**
> This landmark trial, led by renowned investigators at prestigious academic centers, enrolled an impressive 7020 patients across 590 sites in 42 countries and attracted widespread attention from major media outlets.

**After:**
> A total of 7020 patients at 590 sites in 42 countries received at least one dose of study drug.

### 3. Superficial Analyses with -ing Endings

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing...

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth.

**Before:**
> Hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 2.7% of patients receiving empagliflozin compared to 4.1% with placebo (HR 0.65; P = 0.002), highlighting the potential cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition. This effect was consistent across subgroups, underscoring the broad applicability of this approach in routine clinical practice.

**After:**
> Hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 2.7% of patients receiving empagliflozin compared to 4.1% with placebo (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.85; P = 0.002). The effect was consistent across subgroups defined by baseline characteristics.

---

### 4. Promotional and Advertisement-like Language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Problem:** LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially for "cultural heritage" topics.

**Before:**
> This groundbreaking study showcases the profound impact of empagliflozin and reflects a renewed commitment to improving cardiovascular care. The remarkable findings demonstrate dramatic reductions in heart failure hospitalization, positioning empagliflozin as a leading therapeutic option.

**After:**
> In patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin reduced heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death when added to standard of care.

---

### 5. Vague Attributions and Weasel Words

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)

**Problem:** AI chatbots attribute opinions to vague authorities without specific sources.

**Before:**
> Studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events. Experts argue that these benefits may be related to hemodynamic effects. Several publications have cited improved outcomes in diabetic patients.

**After:**
> In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death by 38% and hospitalization for heart failure by 35%.

---

### 6. Outline-like "Challenges and Future Prospects" Sections

**Words to watch:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook

**Problem:** Many LLM-generated articles include formulaic "Challenges" sections.

**Before:**
> Despite its rigorous methodology, this trial faces several challenges typical of large clinical studies, including the lack of objective cardiac measurements. Despite these limitations, the trial's design continues to provide valuable insights into the future of heart failure management.

**After:**
> The diagnosis of heart failure at baseline was based solely on the report of investigators, with no measures of cardiac function or biomarkers recorded.

---

## LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR PATTERNS

### 7. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words

**High-frequency AI words:** Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur.

**Before:**
> Additionally, empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death by 34%, a pivotal finding in the evolving therapeutic landscape. The number needed to treat was 35 over 3 years, underscoring the crucial clinical value of this intervention.

**After:**
> Empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death by 34%. The number needed to treat to prevent one event was 35 over 3 years.

---

### 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Heart failure serves as the leading cause of hospitalization in patients over 65, standing as a major clinical burden and representing a significant unmet therapeutic need.

**After:**
> Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients over 65.

---

### 9. Negative Parallelisms

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused.

**Before:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors not only lower blood glucose but also reduce cardiovascular events. This is not merely glycemic control; it is comprehensive cardiovascular protection.

**After:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood glucose and reduce cardiovascular events.

---

### 10. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors lower glucose, reduce cardiovascular events, and improve renal outcomes. These agents offer efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Benefits span metabolic, cardiovascular, and renal domains.

**After:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors lower glucose and reduce cardiovascular events. They also slow kidney disease progression.

---

### 11. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> Patients in the empagliflozin group had lower hospitalization rates (2.7% vs. 4.1%). Participants also demonstrated reduced cardiovascular mortality (3.7% vs. 5.9%). Subjects experienced decreased all-cause death rates (5.7% vs. 8.3%).

**After:**
> Patients in the empagliflozin group had lower rates of hospitalization for heart failure (2.7% vs. 4.1%), cardiovascular death (3.7% vs. 5.9%), and all-cause mortality (5.7% vs. 8.3%).

---

### 12. False Ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

**Before:**
> The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors span from improved renal function to enhanced cardiac outcomes, from better metabolic control to reduced hospitalization rates.

**After:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors reduce hospitalization for heart failure and improve renal outcomes. They also lower HbA1c modestly.

---

## STYLE PATTERNS

### 13. Em Dash Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes (—) more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing.

**Before:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors—a relatively new drug class—have transformed heart failure treatment. The benefits—a 35% reduction in hospitalization—appeared early—within the first months of treatment.

**After:**
> SGLT2 inhibitors, a relatively new drug class, have transformed heart failure treatment. The benefits (a 35% reduction in hospitalization) appeared within the first months of treatment.

---

### 14. Title Case in Headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings.

**Before:**
> ## Statistical Analysis And Primary Endpoints

**After:**
> ## Statistical analysis and primary endpoints

---

### 15. Curly Quotation Marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes ("...") instead of straight quotes ("...").

**Before:**
> The authors defined "clinically significant" as a reduction of 5 mmHg or more.

**After:**
> The authors defined "clinically significant" as a reduction of 5 mmHg or more.

---

## FILLER AND HEDGING

### 16. Filler Phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to assess efficacy" → "To assess efficacy"
- "Due to the fact that patients were excluded" → "Because patients were excluded"
- "At the present time" → "Currently" or omit
- "It is important to note that mortality was reduced" → "Mortality was reduced"
- "The study has the ability to detect" → "The study can detect"
- "With respect to safety endpoints" → "For safety endpoints"

---

### 17. Excessive Hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> These findings may suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to confer beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes in select patient populations.

**After:**
> These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events.

---

### 18. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> Empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality, representing a major step in the right direction for cardiovascular medicine. The future looks bright for patients with type 2 diabetes as these exciting findings continue to reshape clinical practice.
